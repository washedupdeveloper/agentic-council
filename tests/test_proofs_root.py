"""A proof must blame the caller's bad path, not a binary that is present and working.

Measured: a re-adjudication pointed `--repo` at a tree that did not exist, and every `command`
proof came back `unrunnable — /nix/store/…/gitleaks is not installed` while that binary ran fine.
`subprocess.run` raises FileNotFoundError for a missing CWD as well as a missing executable, and
the handler reported both as "not installed".

Run standalone: python tests/test_proofs_root.py
