"""Adjudicate: the orchestrator demands a proof for every claim, and records what it settled.

A finding is a claim. `protocol/proofs.json` says what a checkable claim looks like; this module is
where the orchestrator *asks* for that check, runs it, and writes down the result — including, and
this is the point, the claims it could not settle.

Four states per finding, and only one of them is a pass:

| state | meaning | blocks certification |
|---|---|---|
| `confirmed` | the proof reproduced, and its control failed as required | **yes** — a real defect |
| `refuted` | the proof failed to reproduce | no — there is no defect to answer |
| `unsettled` | no proof, an uncontrolled proof, or a control that also passed | **yes** — nobody knows |
| `unrunnable` | the proof could not run here (no browser, no server, bad params) | **yes** — nobody knows |

`refuted` is the only state that clears a blocking finding, which is the asymmetry that matters: a
claim is guilty until its proof fails. The run is then never "fine"; it is either certified, or it
names what stopped it.

What this does NOT do: it does not decide the verdict, and it does not touch the score. Wiring the
verdict to these states is the next step, deliberately separate so the change can be measured on its
own. Until then a run is adjudicated and still scored as before — and `enforced: false` says so in
the output, so a reader cannot mistake the report for the gate.
