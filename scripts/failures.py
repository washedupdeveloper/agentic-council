"""Classify why a sample produced no scoreable artefact — from the runner's own words.

The provider outage that cost three good-rung samples read:

    HTTP 404 — no marketplace sellers meet the minimum 89% discount

and left nothing behind but a missing file. `collect` said "not run", which is the same thing it
says for a rung nobody ever attempted. These helpers keep the difference: a runner records every
attempt and the reason it failed, so an outage is visible in the corpus instead of silent.
